Learning Resources
● Golang Tutorial : Go Full Course
● Golang Doc
1. Project Setup and Basic Structure
1.1 Project Initialization
● Set up a Go module with proper package structure
● Implement dependency management using Go modules
● Create a configuration system using environment variables
● Set up a logging framework (e.g., zerolog, zap, or slog)
● Implement graceful shutdown handling
1.2 Database Design and Setup
● Design database schema with proper relationships and indices
● Implement database migrations system
Table Name Columns
users id, username, email, password_hash, role,
created_at, updated_at
transactions id, from_user_id, to_user_id, amount,
type, status, created_at
balances user_id, amount, last_updated_at
Table Name Columns
audit_logs id, entity_type, entity_id, action, details,
created_at
2. Core Implementation
2.1 Domain Models and Interfaces
● Implement domain models using Go structs:
○ User struct with methods for validation
○ Transaction struct with state management
○ Balance struct with thread-safe operations
● Define interfaces for services and repositories
● Implement JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for all models
2.2 Concurrent Processing System
● Create a worker pool for processing transactions
● Implement a transaction queue using channels
● Use sync.RWMutex for thread-safe balance updates
● Implement atomic counters for transaction statistics
● Create a concurrent task processor for batch operations
2.3 Core Services
● UserService:
○ User registration with password hashing
○ User authentication
○ Role-based authorization
● TransactionService:
○ Credit/debit operations
○ Transfer between accounts
○ Transaction rollback mechanism
● BalanceService:
○ Thread-safe balance updates
○ Historical balance tracking
○ Balance calculation optimization
3. API Implementation
3.1 HTTP Server Setup
● Implement a custom router with middleware support
● Set up CORS and security headers
● Implement rate limiting
● Add request logging and tracking
3.2 API Endpoints
● Authentication Endpoints:
○ POST /api/v1/auth/register
○ POST /api/v1/auth/login
○ POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
● User Management Endpoints:
○ GET /api/v1/users
○ GET /api/v1/users/{id}
○ PUT /api/v1/users/{id}
○ DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}
● Transaction Endpoints:
○ POST /api/v1/transactions/credit
○ POST /api/v1/transactions/debit
○ POST /api/v1/transactions/transfer
○ GET /api/v1/transactions/history
○ GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}
● Balance Endpoints:
○ GET /api/v1/balances/current

○ Application service
○ Database service
○ Redis for caching
○ Monitoring services
4.2 Monitoring and Observability
● Implement Prometheus metrics
● Set up Grafana dashboards
● Add distributed tracing
● Implement structured logging
5. Extra Features
● Implement Event Sourcing:
○ Store all state changes as events
○ Rebuild state from event stream
○ Implement event replay functionality
● Add Caching Layer:
○ Implement Redis caching
○ Cache invalidation strategies
○ Cache warm-up mechanisms
● Implement Advanced Features:
○ Scheduled transactions
○ Batch transaction processing
○ Transaction limits and rules
○ Multi-currency support
● High Availability Setup:
○ Database replication
○ Load balancing
○ Circuit breaker implementation
○ Fallback mechanisms
6: Dockerize
● Dockerize your project after watching the tutorial.
● You need to create Dockerfile for your project.
● Your need to use docker-compose.
